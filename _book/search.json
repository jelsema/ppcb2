    "text": "Preface\n\nThis cookbook is mainly for my own use, or to share with friends. The name is an homage to the book and movie The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, mainly because of a line from the movie that I’ve co-oped for the subtitle.\nI’m not a chef by any stretch, so I look up recipes online. But recipe websites tend to be terrible. They’re either riddled with ads, or have a 3-page story about some rando’s spiritual experience with chives that one time before getting to the recipe. And the recipe is all anyone is there for: The ingredients and the directions. That’s what I’m doing here. In a couple places I may veer more descriptive, but I try to avoid that as much as possible.\nAll that is to say I’m usually not the inventor of these recipes. Sometimes I’ve tweaked them a bit, sometimes not. Usually I’ll provide a link to the original source in case you want to read some story about how garlic is friendly but pepper is moody. Chances are you don’t want to, because that’s stupid. I used to keep recipes in a Google Document, but the app would sometimes restart when flipping around tabs. That got annoying, so I decided to write it up in an e-book. Which was also practice for creating an e-book.\nMost of the recipes are dairy-free, due to a household need for this. The recipes may just mention “oat milk” or “vegan butter”, etc. Most of the time you can use regular milk or butter. If there’s something important I’ll put a note in the recipie. Otherwise just check the Substitutions page.\nI’ll probably be adding more recipes over time, maybe rearranging things a bit, and adding some pictures, because why not? If you know me and have a recipe that you’d like but don’t want to always go to whatever ad-infested blog, feel free to let me know and I might add it.\nAnyway, if you found this I hope it’s useful. If not, I don’t really care. Also, hopefully you won’t ever read this introduction again, because y’all just want the recipe.",

    "text": "Milk\nPretty much all of the recipes need to avoid several allergens due to a household need. In particular dairy, soy, and eggs. Below I list some common items and substitutions that I use.\nPretty much any alternative milk works. I tend to use oat milk, and have also used almond milk. Coconut milk tends to be a bit sweeter, so I try to avoid that.\nOne thing to watch out for is that many of the alternative milks are sweetened or flavored with vanilla. That can throw off some of the recipes (especially the gravy). So if you’re using this, make sure to get unsweetened and unflavored.",

I haven’t tried that as yet.\n\nFor things that need whipped eggs (think: quiche, scrambled eggs, etc), the JUST Egg liquid is a good replacement.\nFor baking, there are some powders that you mix in, such as Bob’s Red Mill Egg Replacer. These work in some cases, but don’t seem to have the same binding power. This leads to me getting mad when I make waffles.",
