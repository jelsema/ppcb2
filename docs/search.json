    "text": "Preface\n\nThis cookbook is mainly for my own use, or to share with friends. The name is an homage to the book and movie The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, mainly because of a line from the movie that I’ve co-oped for the subtitle.\nI’m not a chef by any stretch, so I look up recipes online. But recipe websites tend to be terrible. They’re either riddled with ads, or have a 3-page story about some rando’s spiritual experience with chives that one time before getting to the recipe. And the recipe is all anyone is there for: The ingredients and the directions. That’s what I’m doing here. In a couple places I may veer more descriptive, but I try to avoid that as much as possible.\nAll that is to say I’m usually not the inventor of these recipes. Sometimes I’ve tweaked them a bit, sometimes not. Usually I’ll provide a link to the original source in case you want to read some story about how garlic is friendly but pepper is moody. Chances are you don’t want to, because that’s stupid. I used to keep recipes in a Google Document, but the app would sometimes restart when flipping around tabs. That got annoying, so I decided to write it up in an e-book. Which was also practice for creating an e-book.\nMost of the recipes are dairy-free, due to a household need for this. The recipes may just mention “oat milk” or “vegan butter”, etc. Most of the time you can use regular milk or butter. If there’s something important I’ll put a note in the recipie. Otherwise just check the Substitutions page.\nI’ll probably be adding more recipes over time, maybe rearranging things a bit, and adding some pictures, because why not? If you know me and have a recipe that you’d like but don’t want to always go to whatever ad-infested blog, feel free to let me know and I might add it.\nAnyway, if you found this I hope it’s useful. If not, I don’t really care. Also, hopefully you won’t ever read this introduction again, because y’all just want the recipe.",

    "text": "Milk\nPretty much all of the recipes need to avoid several allergens due to a household need. In particular dairy, soy, and eggs. Below I list some common items and substitutions that I use.\nPretty much any alternative milk works. I tend to use oat milk, and have also used almond milk. Coconut milk tends to be a bit sweeter, so I try to avoid that.\nOne thing to watch out for is that many of the alternative milks are sweetened or flavored with vanilla. That can throw off some of the recipes (especially the gravy). So if you’re using this, make sure to get unsweetened and unflavored.",

Place them in the skillet They can touch each other, or there can be a bit of space, it doesn’t matter that much.\nBrush the tops and sides with some melted butter and bake for 10-15 minutes.\n\nWhile the biscuits are baking, make the frosting If you do this well before the biscuits are done cooking, it will have a chance to congeal slightly.\n\nMelt the butter.\nAdd the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract and whisk until smooth.\nWhen the cinnamon biscuits are done, try to let them cool before drizzling with the glaze, as that will help prevent it from all running down the sides. If you let he glaze cool a bit, that will also help in this regard.\n\nVariations:\n\nFilling: I usually use 1/2 coconut sugar and 1/2 monkfruit sugar. You get the sweetness with less calories.\nFrosting: I use the monkfruit powered sugar. It seems to dissolve more than regular powdered sugar, though, so I increase that by about 1/3.\nYou can swap (or just add) maple syrup for vanilla extra in the frosting.\nYou can also add some cream cheese, because why not?\nAdjust the amount of powdered sugar/milk in the frosting to make it more or less runny as you like.\nOtherwise don’t change these. They’re perfect as they are.\n\nNotes:\n\nIf you don’t have a cast iron skillet, I guess you can use a 9x9 baking pan. But I will judge you for that.\nYou can use lemon juice instead of apple cider vinegar.\nPairs will with bacon, especially if you make some extra frosting and drizzle a bit of that on the bacon.",

Or jump straight to hash browns.\nStart frying the chorizo. Personally, I like to break it up into many chunks and fry it to the point that it gets a bit crispy or crunchy.\nWhile the chorizo is frying, put some chile, beans, and corn into a smaller pan and set it on low heat. You can start it at higher heat if you want, but it’s just supposed to get warm, so eventually lower the heat. I throw some olive oil in the pan as well.\nWhen the chorizo is done, put it on a plate and crack 1-2 eggs into the pan. Prepare them how you like, my preference is over-medium, but scrambled is also good.\nWhile the egg is cooking, use another pan to crisp the tortilla. Depending on how quickly your eggs finish, you might need to start this before the eggs.\nWhen the tortilla has a little bit of crisp (on both sides), but not too much, put it on your plate, add the eggs, add some of the chile/corn/bean mixture, and add the chorizo.\n\nVariations:\n\nIf you don’t have green chile, you can use salsa as a substitute, but know that I’m judging you for it.\nYou don’t have to include the corn and beans. Really you don’t have to include anything, but then why are you following this recipe?\nIf you would rather your tortilla be soft, don’t fry it (one less pan, hooray!). You can just use it plain, or warm it up slightly. A flour tortilla is probably better if you’re doing this.\nI like to add several more things to my huevos rancheros: Guacamole, cheese (cotija!), and sometimes a drizzle of my southwest dressing.\n\nNotes:\n\nI often have a black bean and corn mixture on hand (literally just a can of black beans, and a can of corn, both drained, and then dumped into the same bowl). It goes great on salads, quesadillas, this, and probably more that I’m forgetting. If you don’t have that, you may want to make sure you have enough people to make breakfast for, have other uses for the corn and beans, or forgo the corn and beans.",

Scrambled works great, though I prefer over-medium.\nMix up the potatoes, sausage, and onion/green peppers. Add the eggs on top, salt and pepper to taste.\n\nVariations:\n\nDrizzle some BBQ sauce over the top. I rather like BBQ Carnivores sauces for this.\nCheese is a good addition to this dish.\nA layer of sausage gravy also goes nicely with a scramble.\nInstead of breakfast sausage, you can use (smoked) pulled pork or brisket.\n\nNotes:\n\nA slice of toast with butter complements this meal very nicely.\nYou can put the onion and green pepper in with the potatoes, but then the potatoes tend to absorb the moisture and lose their crispyness, which I don’t like.",

You can use your fingers to smash it, or one of those butter-cutter things.\nAdd the water and start mixing. At some point it will come together, but may still be a bit crumbly. That’s okay. You can add a bit more water or just dump it out and try to pack it a bit like snow.\nMake sure there’s a good dusting of flour on the mat, and then some for on top of the dough.\nFlatten out the dough with your hand. If there are any crumbly edges, I’d try to break bits off and fill in gaps. Also, I like to do this on a silicon mat.\nNot needed, but I like to cover the dough with parchment paper, then use the rolling pin on that to roll out the dough. Again, the edges may get a bit broken. Use a dough scraper or spatula to cut off bits and fill in gaps. You may need to do this once or twice to get the dough evenly rolled and approximately the right size for your pie dish.\nCarefully scrape the crust off the surface and transfer to the pie dish. It might break again. Just do some more surgery to fill in gaps or smooth over cracks.\nI put the parchment paper back on, and then fill the inside with pie crust weights. If you don’t have those, a second (slightly smaller) pie dish works reasonably well. The goal is to keep the crust weighted down so it doesn’t expand.\nBake for 15-20 minutes. After that, take the top pie dish out and check the crust.\nYou may want to bake it another 5-10 minutes if it still feels a little too-soft. I find this to be pretty flexible. The worst case is that the bottom of the final quiche has a less crispy crust, but that hasn’t stopped me from enjoying it.\n\n\nComment: The parchment paper helps keep the rolling pin clean, as well as the second pie dish.\n\nFilling\nAs the crust is baking, prepare the filling.\n\nCook any meats, saute any veggies.\nMix the eggs together, but not “vigorously”. Mainly just break the yolks and get it gently mixed with the white. If you whisk it too much, then it will rise more when baking and risk overflowing the crust.\nAdd the milk, as well as any salt and pepper, and again gently mix. I don’t really measure the salt and pepper here, I just do a few good shakes from each container.\nSet aside, hopefully as it sits any over-whisking will settle down.\n\nFinal Preparation\n\nWhen the crust is done, reduce the oven to 350°. You don’t necessarily have to wait for it to cool down, but if you bake the quiche at 400° it might get a little extra-brown on top. Though that might not be a particularly bad thing. add “toppings” first. If there are veggies, I tend to put those on top of the meat. That probably doesn’t matter. I do keep the cheese (dairy-free) on top.\nPour the egg/milk mixture over. Try pour it around evenly, not all in one spot. I think the milk will run through the ingredients easier than the egg, so it might get a little unbalanced if you just pour it all in the middle. But maybe I’m crazy.\nHopefully the egg mixture will come up to 1/4 inch or so from the top of the crust. If it’s much higher, you may be in for an adventure.\nPut the quiche into the oven. I recommend putting the pie dish onto a baking sheet, just in case the filling rises and spills over the edge.\nBake for 35-45 minutes. If you gently shake it, it shouldn’t jiggle, except maybe at the middle. You can use a fork to poke in the middle and make sure the egg is fully cooked.\nAlton Brown says it should jiggle a little bit in the middle, but he also says to let the quiche rest for 30 minutes after it’s done. That might let the inside finish up. However, as we all know, the correct way to eat something is straight out of the oven so that you scald the entire inside of your mouth.\nBut seriously, give it a little time. At least 10-15 minutes.\n\nVariations:\n\nThis works pretty well with the JUST Egg. To do this, replace the eggs and milk with:\n\n1 carton of liquid JUST Egg (16 oz)\n2 tsp baking powder\n1.5 - 2 tbsp flour\nIf you have it, some black lava salt (8-12 shakes)\nSalt and pepper as before.\nThe flour and baking power helps to give a bit of structure and rise for the JUST Egg, the black lava salt gives it a little bit more of the taste.\n\nThe “toppings” to mix in can vary. I’ve enjoyed the following:\n\nChorizo (1/2 pound); onions, green peppers, and green chile (all sauteed); dairy-free cheddar.\nSausage, home fries / hash browns (already fried), peppers and onions (sauteed); dairy-free cheddar\n\n\nNotes:\n\nAlton Brown’s recipie called for 2 eggs. I’m not sure why I use more, my pie dish may have been slightly larger.\nI’m not sold on the sugar in the crust. That came from the recipe on the pie dish. Maybe for a sweet pie it’s better, but for a savory pie I think it might be preferable to note have sugar.",
