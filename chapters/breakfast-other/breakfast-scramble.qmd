## Breakfast Scramble

<!-----

This is a favorite of mine (though I like the huevos rancheros better). Very easy, filling, and delicious. Plenty of room for variation as well. Like with the huevos rancheros, this is intended to be 2 servings.


**Source:** Imitating a fairly common restaurant dish.


**Ingredients:**


```{r}
#| label: breakfast-scramble

dat <- tibble(
  Ingredients = c(
    "3 medium red potatoes",
    "1/3 lb brakfast sausage",
    "4 eggs",
    "Copped onion",
    "Chopped green pepper"
  ),
  Tools = c(
    "Skillet x2",
    "Spatulas",
    "Cooking oil",
    "",
    ""
  )
)


dat |> 
  tt(  theme = "striped" ) |> 
  style_tt( i=0, background=bgcol, color="white") #|> 
  # style_tt( i=5, j=2, background=bgcol, color="white", bold=TRUE )
  # style_tt( i=0, line = "t", line_color="black", line_width = tlwd) |> 
  # style_tt( i=1, line = "t", line_color="black", line_width = tlwd) |> 
  # style_tt( i=8, line = "b", line_color="black", line_width = tlwd) |> 
  # style_tt( i=4, j=2, line = "t", line_color="black", line_width = tlwd )  |> 
  # style_tt( i=4, j=2, line = "b", line_color="black", line_width = tlwd )  |> 


```



**Directions:**

1. Start making home fries
2. In another pan, start frying the sausage.
3. Occassionally stir the potatoes around so that they get crisped on all sides (this is the reason for the medium/high heat).
4. Sautee a handful or two of diced onion and green peppers in a separate pan (could be the one you used for sausage).
5. Once the sausage is done, you can add it to the potatoes.
6, Once your potatoes are almost done, start frying your egg(s) however you like. Scrambled works great, though I prefer over-medium.
7. Mix up the potatoes, sausage, and onion/green peppers. Add the eggs on top, salt and pepper to taste.



**Variations:**

- Drizzle some BBQ sauce over the top. I rather like [BBQ Carnivores](https://bbqcarnivores.com/) sauces for this.
- Cheese is a good addition to this dish.
- A layer of sausage gravy also goes nicely with a scramble.
- Instead of breakfast sausage, you can use (smoked) pulled pork or brisket.



**Notes:**

- A slice of toast with butter complements this meal very nicely.
- You can put the onion and green pepper in with the potatoes, but then the potatoes tend to absorb the moisture and lose their crispyness, which I donâ€™t like.
